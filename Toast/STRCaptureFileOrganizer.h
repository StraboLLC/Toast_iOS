/**
 See also [STRCaptureFileManager].
 
 Contains the logic for saving temporary capture files to the application documents directory.
 
 This class is used by the STRCaptureViewController to move files to the appropriate locations after a capture has been completed. It also contains some file management helper methods for use with handling strabo captures.
 
 This class is similar to that in the STRABO-MultiRecorder SDK except that instead of creating a Capture Info JSON file, it builds a capture object in CoreData. The CaptureInfo object is created on-the-fly during upload.
 
 @warning It should not be necessary to use an instance of this class when implementing the Strabo MultiRecorder SDK. Please see [STRCaptureFileManager] instead.
